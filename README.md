# Data-Structures
This contains all the programs for data structures that are a part of the syllabus of MAKAUT 2nd year Computer Science and engineering course.

All programs are written in java in IntelliJ IDEA.

The .java files can be found in \src  
The .c files can be found in \src-c  
The .js cfiles can be found in \src-javascript  
The .py cfiles can be found in \src-python  


# Array
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. Its used to store multiple items of the same type together. 

# Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

# Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.


# Queue
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

# Tree
 Tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
